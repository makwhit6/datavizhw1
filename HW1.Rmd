## I am not sure if this really answers my question as clearly as I expected it to. I guess I can tell that students who passed with distinction were very unlikely to register late for the course, anyhow. Also I guess I noticed that the eventually "Withdrawn" students didn't have as pronounced of a widening about a month before the course started. Interesting.
